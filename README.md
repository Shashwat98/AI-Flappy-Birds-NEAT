# AI-Flappy-Birds-NEAT


The Flappy Bird game is simulated for multiple generations using the NEAT algorithm.
Neural networks control the birds, and their performance is evaluated based on their ability to navigate through pipes.
The NEAT algorithm evolves the population of neural networks over generations, optimizing them for playing the game.
The training process aims to produce a neural network that can effectively control the Flappy Bird character to achieve a high score in the game.
